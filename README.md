# Will You Be My Valentine? ðŸ’Œ

This project is designed to be an interactive webpage to ask someone to be your Valentine.

---

## How It Works 

This project consists of a simple webpage with a "Yes" and "No" button. When the user clicks the "No" button, the button text changes to a series of  messages, and the "Yes" button grows larger. If the user clicks the "Yes" button, they are redirected to a new page (`yes_page.html`).

---

### Features:
- **Interactive Buttons**: The "No" button cycles through , while the "Yes" button grows in size.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is designed to work on all screen sizes.
